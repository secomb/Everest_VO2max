# Everest_VO2max
**Simulation of oxygen uptake and utilization with altered hemoglobin-oxygen affinity at altitude**

These MATLAB files accompany the manuscript "The dependence of maximum oxygen uptake and utilization (VO2max) on hemoglobin-oxygen affinity and altitude" by K.L. Webb, M.J. Joyner, C.C. Wiggins, T.W. Secomb and T.K. Roy (under review)

1. The program Everest_VO2max.m generates estimates of VO2max for subjects with normal and altered hemoglobin-oxygen affinity at altitude.  The additional files included contain required functions and must be placed in the same directory as the main program.
